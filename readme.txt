HAVE THE YARD DISNEY+ EXTENSION FOR FREE WITH SOURCE CODE!

HOW TO INSTALL THE DCOM DISNEY+ CHROME EXTENSION:


1. Open Google Chrome/Firefox and click on the extension symbol in the top right of the browser.  
   2. Click on “Manage Extensions”  
      3. Click on “Load Unpacked” 
         4. Unzip your extension folder you downloaded, and select it

As long as you are an active Patreon subscriber, the extension should be working. Audio of our voices will automatically synchronize if you move the playhead, and you can toggle the volume of our voices separate from the audio of the movie by using the slider with the Yard logo next to it.
